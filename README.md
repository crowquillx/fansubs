# fansubs

collection of subs i have worked on - starting in dec 2022, I will eventually update this to include older subs that I have worked on but would probably like to make changes to them before doing so.

###### S1
not uploaded here yet, things I want to redo. done for sam's release, modified moo-shi. 
###### S2
Base CyC subs with most dialogue taken from CR. When I didn't like the line from either of the scripts or the dub, I added my own. Used existing CyC typesetting while making changes to most signs (adding blur, improving tracking, etc) and adding new TS where it was missing. Dialogue and OP/ED styling were changed to match commie. OP/ED TL are unchanged from CyC/tlacat.
